Presented here is a proof-of-concept realization of a shader generator for Unity, empowered by ChatGPT.

## How to try it

To access the ChatGPT API, it is necessary to create an API key through your account page. 
Subsequently, set the generated key in the Project Settings by navigating to Edit > Project Settings > AI Shader > API Key.

**CAUTION** - The API key is stored in `UserSettings/AIShaderSettings.asset`.
When distributing your project to others, ensure to exclude the specified directory.
