This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a ChatGPT-powered shader generator for Unity.

## How to try it

You have to generate an API key to use the ChatGPT API.
Please generate it on your [account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
and set it on the Project Settings page (Edit > Project Settings > AI Shader > API Key).

**CAUTION** - The API key is stored in `UserSettings/AIShaderSettings.asset`.
You must exclude the directory when sharing your project with others.
